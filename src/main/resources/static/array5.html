    Sandrita had a collection of favorite specially shaped stones that she used to pick in the orphanage playground.
    Her "buddies" used to steal some of her stones! In one of her nights going thru JavaScript tutorials given by some
    random Indian guy on Youtube, Sandrita came across Arrays and she thought "Oh, what a beautiful way to keep track
    of my stones!"
    <br>
    Which of the following configurations will allow Sandrita to keep track of her collection?
