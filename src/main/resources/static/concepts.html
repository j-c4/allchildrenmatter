<p>1) Programming Languages - JavaScript
    <br>
    A programming language is an artificial language that can be used to control the behaviour of a machine, particularly a computer. Programming languages, like human languages, are defined through the use of syntactic and semantic rules, to determine structure and meaning respectively.
    <br>
    The programming language we will be using throughout this course is JavaScript! Simply put JavaScript - aka the Cool Uncle - is a popular programming language for adding interactive functionality and other dynamic web content to web pages.</p>
<br>

    2) Data Types and Variables
    <br>
    -Number-
    <br>A number is a data type used to represent and manipulate numbers like 37 or -9.25.

    <br>
    -String-<br>
    A string is a data type used to represent text rather than numbers. It consists of a set of characters that can also contain spaces and numbers. For example, the word "hamburger" and the phrase "I ate 3 hamburgers" are both strings. Even "12345" could be considered a string, if enclosed in quotation marks…

    <br>
    -Boolean-
    <br>A boolean is - you guessed it - a data type used for creating true/false statements. Boolean expressions use operators such as AND (&&), OR(||) and NOT(!) to compare values and return a true or false result. These boolean operators are described in the following four examples:

    <br>
    x && y - returns True if both x and y are true; returns False if either x or y are false.
    <br>x || y - returns True if either x or y, or both x and y are true; returns False only if x and y are both false.
    <br>! x - returns True if x is false (or null); returns False if x is true.
    <br>
</p>

<p> -Variables-<br>
    A variable is a named reference to a value. That way an unpredictable value can be accessed through a predetermined name. In JavaScript a variable is written (aka declared) using the keyword var.
    <br>Below you can find examples of variables that store different data types:
    <br>
    var age = 7;
    var name = “Sandrita”;
    var isAGirl = true;
    <br>
</p>


<p> 3) Arrays
    <br>An array is a data structure that contains a group of elements. Typically these elements are all of the same data type, such as numbers or strings. Arrays are commonly used in computer programs to organize data so that a related set of values can be easily sorted or searched.

    <br>Please see below an example of an array which stores data of the type string in JavaScript:

    <br>
    var cuteCreatures = [“Unicorn” , “Pony” , “Code Cadet” ,“Cat”];
    <br>
</p>

<p>
    4) Loops<br>
    A loop is a programming structure that repeats a sequence of instructions until a specific condition is met. Programmers use loops to cycle through values, add sums of numbers, repeat functions, and many other things.

    <br>A for loop, as used in JavaScript, has the following structure:

    <br>for (initialExpression; condition; updateExpression) {
    <br>// for loop body
    <br>}

    Please take a look at this practical example:
    <br>
    var dailyNumberOfBeatings = [5 ; 4 ; 8 ; 2 ; 6 ; 5 ; 7];
    <br>
    for (var i = 0 ; i < dailyNumberOfBeatings.length ; i++) {
    <br>console.log(dailyNumberOfBeatings[i]);
    <br>}
    <br>
</p>

<p> 5) Functions<br>
    Functions are "self contained" modules of code that accomplish a specific task. Functions usually "take in" data, process it, and "return" a result. Once a function is written, it can be used over and over and over again!! Functions can then be "called" as many times as needed.
    <br>
    Below is one of the ways to write (aka declare) a function in JavaScript:
    <br>
    function name(parameter1, parameter2) {
    <br>// code to be executed
    <br>}

    A practical example could be:
    <br>
    function myFunction(hoursCodingPerDay, numberOfDays) {
    <br>return hoursCodingPerDay * numberOfDays;   // The function returns the product of p1(hoursCodingPerDay) and p2(numberOfDays).
    <br>}
