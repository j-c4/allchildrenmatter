# All Children Matter

Winner app of the #64 Bootcamp 24h Hackathon - Academia de Código.

## The challenge

The theme of the Hackathon was Monty Python songs. Lucky for us, we got their best song - "Every Sperm is Scacred".

## The idea

A web page game to teach children about programming.

## How it works

You are presented with simple programming questions, one at a time. If you get it right you go on to the next one, otherwise you have to try again from the beginning (children also need to learn about frustration).
In case you need to leave the game halfway through, you can always go back to the question you were by inserting the username and password you used.

## Development

We were pair programming most of the time with teams of 2 to 3 members.

## Technologies

Java 8, Spring-Boot, HTML, CSS, JavaScript, MySQL
